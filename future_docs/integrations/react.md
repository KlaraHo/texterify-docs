In this guide you will learn how to integrate Texterify into your React projects.

## Project setup

We will create a new project with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) which we will use in this tutorial. To create a new project run:

```shell
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

You React app should now be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
